# Task 03 - Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

## Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit, using demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
Source: [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://github.com/Prodigy-InfoTech/data-science-datasets/tree/main/Task%203)

## Steps Performed
1. Data exploration (shape, info, null values, target distribution)
2. Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, train-test split)
3. Model building using Decision Tree Classifier (criterion = entropy, max_depth = 4)
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
5. Visualization of the Decision Tree

## Key Insights
- The model predicts whether a client subscribes to a term deposit with reasonable accuracy.
- Important features include **age, job, marital status, balance, and previous campaign outcomes**.
- Decision Tree is highly interpretable and useful for marketing campaign analysis.
